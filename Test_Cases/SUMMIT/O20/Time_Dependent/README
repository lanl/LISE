The file explains how to time evolve hfb wfs LISE time dependent code.

*** Setup ***
In order to time evolve the O20 wfs the following five files are needed in the working directory: lise-tdslda-gpu, myjob_TD.lsf, wf_p.cwr, wf_n.cwr, info.slda_solver.

*** Inputs ***
The lise-tdslda-gpu is the executable, generated from compiling the code in the LISE-TDSLDA folder (the makefile should be modified depending on the architecture of the machine the simulations are run on). 

wf_p.cwr, wf_n.cwr are the quasiparticle wf files generated from the static solver.
	
The info.slda_solver file is also generated from the static solver and contains the following information about the wfs (in this order): the number of proton wfs, the number of neutron wfs, the proton chemical potential, the neutron chemical potential, the lattice spacing the x,y,z directions, the number of lattice points in the x,y,z directions, and the cutoff for the energy.

The myjob_TD.lsf file is a script used to run the job (will change depending on system). In the jsrun command line:

	jsrun -n 6 -a 1 -g 1 ./lise-tdslda-gpu -g 1 -f 7 -i 0 -s 1000 -t 3600 -e 0 -p 5 -m 5 >& O20_TD.out

	-n -- refers to number of resource sets.
	-a -- number of cpus per resource set.
	-g -- number of gpus per resrouce set.
	-f -- the energy density function (7 is SeaLL1).
	-i -- the run type (0 is fission or standard, 1 is collisions, 2 is a test with plane waves).
	-s -- total number of time steps.
	-t -- total expected run time in seconds (does not need to be accurate).
	-e -- type of external potential (0 for none).
	-p -- number of bootstraps steps before ABM method.
	-m -- order of exponential expansion for Hamiltonian.

*** Running ***
With all inputs set correctly, use the command "bsub myjob_TD.lsf" to run the program.

*** Outputs ***
When the code is finished running (for this working example it should be under 10 mins) the following outputs will be printed:

	dens_all_n.dat.X
	dens_all_p.dat.X

	These files contain the time dependent densities every 10 times steps (each file contains 10 sets of densities).  The densities are recorded in the following order: the number density, kinetic density, spin density, divergence of the current density, spin current density, curl of the current density, and anomalous density (only double complex density).  
	
	occ_p.bn
	occ_n.bn
	eqp_p.bn
	eqp_n.bn
	lz_p.bn
	lz_n.bn

	These files contain the occupation numbers, quasiparticle energies, and single particle orbital angular momentum for protons and neutrons respectively.  In this case expect the files to be empty.  To get results define SAVEOCC in the "vars.h" file when compiling the code.

	wf_n.cwr
	wf_p.cwr

	The wfs are overwritten at the final time.

	results_td.dat
	O20_TD.out

	O20_TD.out is the standard output file, which will contain information at each iteration, such as the particle numbers, total energy, individual components of the energy, and so forth. results_td.dat contains similar information, without explanatory text.  The first 4 columns are time, total energy, number of protons, and number of neutrons. 

*** Expected Results ***
At the end of the O20_TD.out file expect the following results (before the line "program terminated"):

	TIME[900] Ctime=0.000000
	time_current = 7.574184 time_step = 900 w0 = 0.000000 distance = 2.523290
	pairing energy: protons = -0.002577, neutrons = -5.062025
	pairing gap:  protons = 0.037382, neutrons = 1.535493
	#  protons =     8.000736
	# neutrons =    11.999930
	e_kin=  331.046136 e_rho=   -518.289026 e_rhotau=    0.000000 e_laprho=   40.518535 e_so=   -9.589464 e_coul=   13.596243 e_j=    0.000000 e_flow =     0.000038 e_ext =     0.000000 e_cm =     0.000000
	field energy:  -477.770491
	total energy:  -147.782179

*** Checkpoint Restart ***
To restart the code we need an additional two files: restart.info and lise-tdslda-rst-gpu.

The restart.info file will be updated when we reach a number of time steps equal to loop_cp (defined in ctdslda.c in the LISE_TDSLDA folder).  This is currently set to loop_cp = (int) floor(500.0/dt_step), where dt_step is our time spacing.  This file records the last time step.

The lise-tdslda-rst-gpu file is an additional executionable that can be copied from the LISE_TDSLDA folder after the code has been compiled.

The last step is to modify the run line in myjob_TD.lsf to include the new executable (shown in the following line):

	jsrun -n 6 -a 1 -g 1 ./lise-tdslda-rst-gpu -g 1 -f 7 -i 0 -s 1000 -t 3600 -e 0 -p 5 -m 5 >& O20_TD-rst.out
